# Views in Django

Basically a view is the part of the code that can interact directly with the user.
When we call a view in Django, it takes a request and returns a response, that is usually
**html** code.

To dive dipper in this topic, review the 
[official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/class-based-views/).
